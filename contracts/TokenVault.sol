 * Hold tokens for a group investor of investors until the unlock date.

 *
 * - Prepare a spreadsheet for token allocation
 * - Deploy this contract, with the sum to tokens to be distributed, from the owner account
 * - Call setInvestor for all investors from the owner account using a local script and CSV input
 * - Move tokensToBeAllocated in this contract using StandardToken.transfer()
 * - Call lock from the owner account
 * - Wait until the freeze period is over
 * - After the freeze time is over investors can call claim() from their address to get their tokens
